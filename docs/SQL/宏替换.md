# 宏替换

```SQL
-- 生成临时虚拟表
WITH customer_orders (customer_id, total_amount) AS (
   SELECT customer_id, SUM(order_amount) AS total_amount
   FROM orders
   GROUP BY customer_id
)


SELECT customer_id, total_amount
FROM customer_orders
WHERE total_amount > 1000;
```

类似于C的宏替换，在简化子查询上有很好的作用，`with as`的代码只会执行一次，生成类似于虚拟表，可以减少数据库的压力
